## **Project Overview:**

As new investors learn more about the world of cryptocurrency, oftentimes than not, it can be an information overload when it comes to selecting a coin to invest in. The overall idea for this project is to create an A.I chat training bot to help new traders with the overall concept of trading and encourage new users to create their own trading strategies. Through Amazon Lex, this robo-advisor will buy and sell cryptocurrency orders using simulated trading. We use the Sandbox API to retrieve fundamental data (market cap, volume, circulating supply, total supply, and other relevant information) for the following crypto coins: ...  

## **Research Questions:**

During the early planning stages, we came up with the following questions to build and set an overall foundation for the project. 

1. What messages to display and what information from the trader is needed for the robo-advisor?
2. What cryptocurrency fundamentals will be used (market cap, volume, supply, volatility, close and open price (daily, weekly, monthly)?
3. How detailed will this project be? How will it be organized? 

## **Data Collection:**

We will be using Sandbox APIs to fetch the information for supply for this project. We will set up the Amazon Lex to look like a dashboard and will use pandas for data frames to display the information provided by the API. 

**Libraries Utilized:**

- Pandas - Python library and data cleaning
- NumPy - Calculations
- hvPlot - Visual graphics
- sklearn - Supervised learning algorithm
